NOAA Noise Reference Station soundscape metrics will be used to build the pathways and evaluate outputs. Additional soundscape metrics from PAM SI priority data sets will be incorporated based on availability from Soundscape Priority #1 Projects (above). We will create decision-support tools that are relevant at regional and national scales and integrate PAM data with variables to provide context for different soundscapes (environmental data, species-detections, etc).",
