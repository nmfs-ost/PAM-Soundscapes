title: Soundscape Metric Interpretation & Visualization
---
## Establish working group
*Establish working group and create folder in shared Google doc folder.*

## Identify datasets
*Decide on priority Noise Reference Station (NRS) datasets for metric development.*

## Data products to NCEI
*NRS Hybrid Milli-Decade (HMD) products to be included in initial comparison sent to NCEI.*

## Identify visualization options
*Organize and expand on options for HMD data visualizations as originally prepared for PAMscapes, share with working group via Google doc folder for discussion of level 1 visualization goals. Ideas and inspiration will be organized for project team brainstorming and feedback meeting.*

## Develop workplan
*Set-up work plan with Taiki Sakai to evaluate HMD QA/QC with visualizations in PAMscapes including level 1 visualizations such as percentiles, LTSA, and bringing together MANTA and pyPAM default outputs.*

## Present initial results
*Updated PAMscapes tool for HMD QA/QC level 1 visualization will be shared with project team for feedback and further development.*

## Level 2 data product planning
*In coordination with QA/QC tool development, and informed by ongoing collaboration with SoundCoop partners, the Soundscape group will develop level 2 visualization for HMD output by: integrating environmental data (currents, wind, ice, etc.) and time/frequency bins for quantitative visualization (e.g., SPD). The option to integrate these visualizations as additional PAMscapes functionality or publish as separate code on GitHub will be evaluated.*

## Level 3 data product planning
*Plan the development level 3 products from HMD that prioritize and reflect the needs of SI and FMCs including: integration with PACM; noise budgets; sound propagation; automated soundscape analysis; co-variate for species models; categorization from HMD data; repository of labeled HMD data; integration of AIS data.*

## Cloud processing
*Following Cloud Computing project Phase 7 (Software phase II validation), conduct cloud processing for HMD and PAMscapes to apply relevant methods on FMCs priority datasets.*

## Facilitate national comparisons
*Develop additional products or visualizations for nationwide comparison of FMC priority soundscapes.*

## Present project outcomes
*Present tested and functional cloud processing routines for level 1-3 products for all priority data sets for PAM SI reporting and additional science needs.*
